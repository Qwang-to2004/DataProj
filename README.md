Project description
Project Title: Data Analysis and Visualization of Life Expectancy Factors

Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to analyze global life expectancy trends and factors influencing them over the years. The analysis focused on processing, exploring, and visualizing a dataset containing various indicators to understand the relationship between healthcare, socio-economic factors, and life expectancy.

Data Processing:
The project began with the preprocessing of the dataset containing diverse variables such as population, disease prevalence, healthcare expenditure, GDP, and more. Missing data points were handled by imputing mean values for respective columns, ensuring the integrity of subsequent analyses.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Disease Prevalence: The analysis commenced with a comparison of disease prevalence between developed and developing countries. Visual representations using bar plots showcased the incidence rates of diseases like Hepatitis B, Measles, Polio, Diphtheria, and HIV/AIDS.
Expenditure to GDP Ratio: A detailed examination of the total expenditure as a percentage of GDP was conducted from 2000 to 2015 for both developed and developing nations. Plotly visualizations were employed to display these trends, illustrating expenditure over GDP patterns over the years.
Comparative Analysis:
The project delved into comparative assessments between developed and developing countries concerning:
Total Expenditure and GDP percentage between average life expectancy: Visualizations were crafted to compare the total percentage of expenditure to GDP trends from 2000 to 2015 and the average global life expectancy, highlighting the differences and similarities and how they affect life expectancy in general.
Life Expectancy Distribution: A comparative boxplot analysis was executed, discerning life expectancy distributions across developed, developing, and the overall population. This visualization provided insights into disparities among different categories.
Correlation Analysis:
A circular correlation heatmap was generated to depict correlations among various factors influencing life expectancy. This visualization facilitated an understanding of the relationships between key indicators such as population, disease prevalence, healthcare expenditure, GDP, and education.

Description:
This project encompasses a comprehensive analysis of life expectancy trends and factors affecting global healthcare. Leveraging R and diverse libraries such as ggplot2, plotly, corrplot, and more, the exploration spanned data preprocessing, diverse visualizations, comparative analyses, and correlation assessments. The visual representations aid in understanding the intricate interplay between healthcare parameters and their impact on life expectancy across nations.

The project's key insights include disease prevalence comparisons, expenditure trends relative to GDP, comparative analyses between developed and developing nations, and correlation patterns among various health indicators. These findings are invaluable for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers seeking to address global health disparities and enhance healthcare systems.
